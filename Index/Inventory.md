You can carry up to 16 items and equip up to nine items. The more you carry, the slower you move, as indicated on your character sheet.

## Significant items
Only significant items are counted towards encumbrance. Generally, an item that can be carried in one hand takes up one slot, while items that require two hands to carry take up two slots. Big or heavy items may take up three or more slots, as decided by the GM.

### Equipped items
Items that you are holding, wearing, or have somewhere readily available on your person. These can be freely used in combat.

### Inventory
Items that you carry in your pack. These take an action to retrieve in combat.

### Trinkets
Small items like rings, necklaces, etc, that don't weigh anything unless carried in large quantities (GM's judgement).

## Treasure
Every 100 coins take up a slot.

## Expedition resources
Items that are useful for the entire party are considered expedition resources. If one character is carrying the item, there is enough for the entire group to use.

## Notches
When an expendable item is used, or an item is damaged, it gains a Notch. When an item receives three Notches, it is depleted or destroyed. Notches can be cleared for 10% of the original item cost.

- **Weapons and armor:** Weapons gain Notches on Fumbles (rolling a natural 1 on use). Armors gain Notches when protecting from Wounds.
- **Ammunition:** After a fight, roll a d6. On 4-6, mark a Notch on the ammunition.
- **Expedition resources:** Mark a Notch after usage.
- **Other gear:** If used in a way that could break or deplete it, the GM may ask you to mark a Notch.
## Exhaustion
Each level of exhaustion you gain takes up an inventory slot.

## Movement rates
A character can carry a certain amount of items before they are encumbered, as indicated on their character sheets. Getting encumbered means reducing this speed to the level indicated on the character sheet.
