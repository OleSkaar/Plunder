All abilities that use Magic Dice count as spellcasting. Unless the description states otherwise, casting a spell requires a verbal, a somatic component, and an arcane focus.

This means the caster has to loudly utter the arcane incantations, and resolutely mimic the spell's effect with the arcane focus.

An arcane focus is typically a crystal attached to the end of a quarterstaff, but can also take other forms, like a wand or an orb, but it has to be held in at least one hand when casting spells.
## Magic Dice
You get Magic Dice based on your level as a caster. You cast a spell by choosing how many dice you want to invest in it. On a roll of 3 or less, the Magic Dice is spent, but on a roll of 4 or more the they come back immediately. Spent Magic Dice can be regained by spending Hit Dice during a short or long rest, or fully regained after a full rest.

If the spell requires an attack roll, add the MD sum after a hit is confirmed.
## Cantrips
When you are out of Magic Dice, you can cast your spells as cantrips. Use a 1d4 as the Magic Dice. On a roll of 2 or less, you gain a level of exhaustion.
## Concentration
Automatically breaks on being hit.
## Burden
Each spell you know takes up an inventory slot.
## Scrolls and spell books
In order to use a spell from a scroll, you need to understand the language it's written in. Additionally, you need to absorb the magic into your mind before you can use it. This takes a turn, and you need to roll a Magic Dice. On a roll of 1-3, you lose the dice. If you don't have any Magic Dice, you instead gain a level of exhaustion.

The same applies to each spell in a spell book. Once you have absorbed a spell in this way, you may cast the spell by expending one Magic Dice. If the spell has a spell level, use one Magic Dice level.
### Arcane spells
These are written down in arcane runes, often using idiosyncratic cyphers that take time and effort to decode.
### Divine spells
Usually written in Common, or the language of the mystic who committed the spell to paper.
