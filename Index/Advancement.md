When you level up, you may choose to continue with the same class, or select another class. In either case, the table below tells you what you gain at that level.

If you have levels in more than one class, you can select any Ability from either class, including Signature Abilities. You can never have more Abilities from a class than you have levels in that class, however.

|Level|Attack target modifier |Feature|
|---|---|---|
|1|0 |Class Features, Proficiencies, Equipment, Signature Ability|
|2|0 |Ability|
|3|0 |Two New Proficiencies|
|4|-2 |Ability|
|5|-2 |Aspect Score Increase (increase one by +2, or two by +1)|
|6|-2 |Ability|
|7|-5 |Two New Proficiencies|
|8|-5 |Ability|
|9|-5 |Two new Proficiencies|
|10|-7 |Capstone Ability|
