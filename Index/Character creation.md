There are four steps to creating a character:

1. Roll your ability targets
2. Choose your class
3. Choose your kin
4. Choose your origin

### 1. Ability targets
Innate abilities that define a character. Defined in opposition to each other at character creation. Characters are typically good at one or the other, but not both.

Your chosen adventuring profession. Class determines Hit Points, Hit Dice, starting talents, and equipment.
## 3. Kin
Abilities or other boons passed down to by your ancestors.
## 4. Origin
Where you're from, and which languages you speak.
