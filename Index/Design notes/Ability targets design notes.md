> [!NOTE] Design notes
> The values for ability targets are designed to be be somewhere in the middle of the range of open doors in OSE (1-in-6 to 5-in-6) and listen (1-in-6 to 2-in-6). Since players can gain advantage by using items or the environment in Plunder, or gain disadvantage from Wounds or other factors, this range can be expanded both negatively and positively for the player.
> 
> The party's highest Instinct will be used for surprise rolls. The best odds (11) are 50%, equivalent to 3-in-6, while the lowest are 1-in-6, so it fits roughly around OSE's general 2-in-6 odds for surprise.
> 
> Intelligence saves "bake in" the bonus to saves against magic effects. As a result, high Int characters will have higher saves against spells than OSE chars, but they won't get the bonus to other saves, e.g. against wands.
> 
> Courage saves replace saves against fear, which would primarily be from spells. For that reason, the saves are similar to spells, but a little lower to account for it being a rarer effect.
> 
> Cunning saves replaces saves against illusions, and therefore have the same considerations as Courage saves.
