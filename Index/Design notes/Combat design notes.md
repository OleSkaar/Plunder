## Design notes

## Piecemeal armor (optional)
With this rule, armor coverage is not assumed to be complete, but can be pieced together from different parts of an armor, each covering a given hit location. The armor bonus to HP is only given if you have a complete set.

A random table can be made to determine the armor coverage of a given NPC, possibly replacing or applying to the same roll as the HP roll.
