> In OSE, you have to cast the *read magic* spell to be able to read a scroll or a spell book. This is essentially a spell tax to be able to use a given scroll, balancing out the new spell with an expenditure of a precious resource. This balance is maintained here by requiring the use of a Magic Dice.

> Also in OSE, only divine spell casters can use divine spells. However, the scrolls are written in Common. Since divine spellcasting is not really a thing in Plunder, it makes sense to allow anyone who can read the language a shot at understanding a spell. However, if you don't have Magic Dice, it can quickly become taxing to try and use magic.
