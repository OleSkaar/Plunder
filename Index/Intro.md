Plunder is an attempt to create a blend between two RPG play styles: 

- The old school, focused on exploration, pushing your luck, and resource management 
- Modern D&D, emphasizing balance, flavorful character abilities, and unified mechanics

It's compatible with adventures for Original D&D and Old School Renaissance (OSR) games, to take advantage of all the great content produced for these systems over the years. But unlike these retro games, I want to include more interesting player character options.

I called it Plunder as many of its parts are taken from OSR blog posts or other systems. For instance, the magic system is mostly copied from the Goblin Laws of Gaming (GLOG). However, Plunder is also a playground for experimenting with new mechanics. I also want to shake up some long-standing conventions in D&D, like ability scores, armor, and dice roll resolution. See the Features section for an overview of all these new mechanics.

Ultimately, though, the goal of Plunder is to have the mechanics fade into the background, and for players to interact with the game world directly. The system is lightweight and oriented towards common-sense GM rulings over rules. Character stats are static numbers to roll against to speed up action resolution. Combat is intended to be less abstract to hopefully make it more engaging than the typical "I attack the orc again."

This works well with the old school playstyle - we only roll dice when there are consequences for failure, and adventurers are assumed to be competent at adventuring tasks. The GM never fudges rolls, and characters can get wounded or die easily, meaning each roll is a point of tension - a last ditch resort after other ways of solving a problem have been tried. Character abilities are intended as open-ended tools to help solve these problems. There might be some negotiation about the outcome. But instead of reaching for the rule book, the GM makes a call and the game moves forward. 

In the end, we're all at the table to imagine our characters braving dangers and getting stronger while they pile up the loot. So this is my attempt to create a system that's minimalist, fast, but still packed with flavor.
