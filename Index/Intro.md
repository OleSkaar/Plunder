Plunder is an attempt to create a blend between two RPG play styles: 

- The old school, focused on exploration, pushing your luck, and resource management 
- Modern D&D, emphasizing flavorful, balanced, and interesting character abilities, and unified mechanics. 

It's intended to be compatible with adventures for Original D&D and its clones, such as old School Essentials, Labyrinth Lord, because there is just so much great content produced for these systems over the last 40 Years. But unlike these retro systems, I want to include more interesting player character options. 

The reason it's called Plunder is that many of its parts are taken from blog posts or other systems. For instance, the magic system is copied almost wholesale from the Goblin Laws of Gaming (GLOG). However, Plunder is also a play ground for experimenting with new mechanics. Part of the incentive for creating the system was to shake up some long-standing conventions in D&D, like ability scores, Armor class, and dice roll resolution. See the features section for an overview of all these new mechanics.

Ultimately, though, the goal of Plunder is to have the mechanics fade into the background, and for players to interact with the game world directly. The system is lightweight and oriented towards common-sense GM rulings over rules. Character stats are static numbers to roll against to speed up action resolution. Combat is intended to be a little less abstract to (hopefully) make it more engaging than the typical "I attack the orc again."

This works well with the old school play style - we only roll dice when there consequences for failure, and we assume that characters are generally good at adventuring tastes. Together with the fact that the GM never fudges rolls, and the fact that characters can get wounded or die easily, this means that each roll should be a point of tension - more of a last ditch resort of her other ways of solving a problem have been tried. Character abilities are intended as open-ended tools to help solve these problems. There might be some negotiation about the outcome. 
But instead of reaching for the rule book, the GM makes a call and the game moves forward. 

In the end, we're all at the table to imagine our characters braving dangers and getting stronger while they pile up the loot. So this is my attempt to create a system that's minimalist, fast, but still packed with flavor.
