## Abilities
Your character's core physical and mental attributes. There are six abilities, divided into three categories: Body (Strength and Dexterity), Mind (Instinct and Intelligence), and Soul (Courage and Cunning).

## Armor
Grants extra Hit Points, and reduces the severity of Wounds.
## Defense
Determines how difficult it is to hit a target. Calculated based on the character's Dexterity and weapon bonus. All weapons give at least +1 Defense.
## Exhaustion
A measurement of your character's fatigue. Takes up one inventory slot.
## Hit Dice
Your character's reserve stamina, represented by a dice. Characters have one HD per level.

## Hit Points
How much of a beating your character can take before being seriously injured.

## Margin of Failure/Success
This is the amount by which you fail or succeed a d20 check. Most commonly used to determine attack damage. 

For example, Geldan the ranger has a ranged target of 9. He fires an arrow at a goblin equipped with a shield (+2 Defense), for a total Target Number of 11. He rolls a 15 on a d20. His margin of success is 15 - 11 = 4, so the attack does 4 damage.
## Notch
A measure of an item's durability. Each item can take up to three Notches. An item with no Notches is in perfect condition, while an item with three Notches is no longer usable.
## Target
This is a number from 1-20 which determines how likely you are to succeed on a task of average difficulty. To see if you succeed, roll a d20. If you roll equal to or higher than the target number, you succeed.

For example, Torbane the berserker has a Strength target of 14. To force open a stuck door, a task of average difficulty, he needs to roll 14 or higher on a d20.
## Wound
A physical wound suffered by the character, which has a negative effect depending on hit location and severity. Each Wound takes up an inventory slot. Healing a Wound requires a long rest.
