## Abilities
Your character's core physical and mental attributes. There are six abilities, divided into three categories: 

### Body 
Strength and Dexterity

### Mind
Instinct and Intelligence

### Soul
Courage and Cunning

## Armor
Grants extra Hit Points, and reduces the severity of Wounds.

## Bonus action
Granted by some talents. A bonus action takes place immediately following a regular action in combat.

## Defense
Determines how difficult it is to hit a target. Calculated based on the character's Dexterity and weapon bonus. All weapons give at least +1 Defense.

## Exhaustion
A measurement of your character's fatigue. Takes up one inventory slot.

## Hit Dice (HD)
Your character's reserve stamina, represented by a dice. Characters have one HD per level.

## Hit Points (HP)
How much of a beating your character can take before being seriously injured.

## Inventory
All the items your character is carrying with you. Divided into equipped items and packed items.

## Kin
Your character's ancestry.

## Magic Dice (MD)
Your reserves of magical power. To cast a spell, you have to spend Magic Dice.

## Margin of Failure/Success
This is the amount by which you fail or succeed a d20 check. Most commonly used to determine attack damage. 

For example, Geldan the ranger has a ranged target of 9. He fires an arrow at a goblin equipped with a shield (+2 Defense), for a total Target Number of 11. He rolls a 15 on a d20. His margin of success is 15 - 11 = 4, so the attack does 4 damage.

## Notch
A measure of an item's durability. Each item can take up to three Notches. An item with no Notches is in perfect condition, while an item with three Notches is no longer usable.

## Skills
Special knowledge your character has. There are four skill ranks: Apprentice, Journeyman, Expert, Master.

## Talent
A special ability granted by your class or kin.

## Target
This is a number from 1-20 which determines how likely you are to succeed on a task of average difficulty. To see if you succeed, roll a d20. If you roll equal to or higher than the target number, you succeed.

For example, Torbane the berserker has a Strength target of 14. To force open a stuck door, a task of average difficulty, he needs to roll 14 or higher on a d20.

## Wound
A physical wound suffered by the character, which has a negative effect depending on hit location and severity. Each Wound takes up an inventory slot. Healing a Wound requires a long rest.
