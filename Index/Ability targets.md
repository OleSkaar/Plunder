Abilities provide a quick description of your character's physical and mental characteristics. They are used to resolve most actions in the game that require dice rolls.

Each ability is a target that indicates how likely you are to succeed on a task of average difficulty. 

An ability can range from 12 to 18. To resolve an ability check, roll a d20 and compare it to your ability. If it's equal or higher, you succeed. In other words, lower ability targets are better!

Additionally, abilities determine your saving throws and other important characteristics.

The abilities are grouped by categories, and defined in opposition to each other. Characters are typically good at one or the other, not both.

To determine your character's abilities, go through each category and do the following:

1. Pick a favored ability from the two
2. Roll 6d6
3. Assign the three lowest dice the favored ability
4. Assign the remaining dice to the other ability
5. Compare the rolls to the table below, and note the bonuses on your character sheet

> [!NOTE] Design notes
> The values for ability targets are designed to be be somewhere in the middle of the range of open doors in OSE (1-in-6 to 5-in-6) and listen (1-in-6 to 2-in-6). Since players can gain advantage by using items or the environment in Plunder, or gain disadvantage from Wounds or other factors, this range can be expanded both negatively and positively for the player.
> 
> The party's highest Instinct will be used for surprise rolls. The best odds (11) are 50%, equivalent to 3-in-6, while the lowest are 1-in-6, so it fits roughly around OSE's general 2-in-6 odds for surprise.
> 
> Intelligence saves "bake in" the bonus to saves against magic effects. As a result, high Int characters will have higher saves against spells than OSE chars, but they won't get the bonus to other saves, e.g. against wands.
> 
> Courage saves replace saves against fear, which would primarily be from spells. For that reason, the saves are similar to spells, but a little lower to account for it being a rarer effect.
> 
> Cunning saves replaces saves against illusions, and therefore have the same considerations as Courage saves.
