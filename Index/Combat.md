## Combat sequence

Combat is divided into rounds. Each round has six phases. Each combatant can move once and perform one action per round.

1. Declare spells
2. Monster morale
3. Movement
4. Ranged attacks
5. Spells
6. Melee and miscellaneous

### Movement
Anyone moving out of melee needs to take a Dexterity check modified by the target's Defense, or take damage equal to the margin of failure. If there is conflict of who will reach a space first, the player needs to succeed on a Dexterity check to be first.

### Simultaneous actions
In each phase, everyone who wants to act declares their action. Then, they roll a d20 for their action. Sort the rolls from highest to lowest, and resolve them in that order. Actions by combatants early in the round can invalidate actions of combatants who act later. It's not possible to redeclare actions.

For example: Regdar the fighter is fighting an orc. The orc wants to shove Regdar away, while Regdar is trying to hit the orc with his sword. Regdar rolls 15, while the orc rolls 18. The orc goes first, and pushes Regdar out of melee range. Regdar is now out of melee range, so his attack now misses despite rolling successfully.
#### Advantage and disadvantage
If an action by an earlier combatant confers advantage or disadvantage on a later roll, that combatant rolls a second d20 when their action is being resolved, and uses that result. 

## Attacking
When you attack someone, the target number is your relevant attack target plus the enemy's Defense. If the roll is equal or higher than the target, it's a hit. 

Damage is equal to the margin of success, plus any modifiers. A successful attack always does at least 1 damage, even if a modifier would bring it below 1.

Some weapons have properties that grant different damage calculations.

Also, some creatures have attacks that are determined by a damage dice instead of this calculation.
### Melee attacks
In melee combat, the target's Defense is determined by the weapons they have equipped plus their Dexterity modifier or other special modifiers. Typically, longer and well-balanced weapons have higher Defense. 

When you score a hit in melee, add your melee damage bonus, which is based on your Strength.

> Melee attacks are made using Dexterity. Damage is modified by Strength.

### Ranged attacks
When you make a ranged attack, your enemy's Defense is their Dexterity modifier or any other evasion modifier they have. 

Additionally, each ranged weapon has a range modifier, noted in the weapon description. Apply this modifier to the enemy's Defense.

**Short range:**  -1
**Medium range:** +0
**Long range:** +1
**Beyond long range:** Attack not possible

Damage is equal to the margin of success.

> Ranged attacks are made using Instinct.

### Spell attacks
When casting a spell in combat, use the same rules as ranged attacks.

>[!info]
>Spell attacks are made using Intelligence

## Hit locations and attack type
When attacking, the attacker specifies what type of attack they want to make, and where the attack is made: head, torso, right or left arm, right or left leg.

Making the same kind of attack twice in a row grants disadvantage on that attack roll.

> Do not repeat the tactics which have gained you one victory, but let your methods be regulated by the infinite variety of circumstances.

— Sun Tzu, the Art of War
### Critical Hits
If the attacker rolls a natural 20, the attack is always a hit. Additionally, the target receives a Wound that lasts until the end of their next turn, and their armor is damaged and takes one Notch. Roll on the Wound Table for the hit location to determine the Wound’s nature.

### Fumbles
A natural 1 on an attack roll is a miss regardless of the target’s Defense and results in a mishap. This means that they slam their weapon into a nearby obstacle, overextend their bow, or overcharge their arcane focus. The item is damaged and takes one Notch.
## Hit Points and Wounds
Hit Points are a measure of your stamina and ability to avoid getting seriously injured.

Any damage that reduces you to 0 Hit Points will give you a Wound. Look up the damage on the Wound Table to determine its nature.

Each Wound takes up one Inventory slot. If all your inventory slots are filled up with Wounds or Exhaustion, you’re dead.
### Instant Death
If a character would gain a Wound and the damage is equal to their maximum HP, they instead die instantly.
### How to kill a monster
A monster or NPC can have a number of Wounds equivalent to half their Hit Dice, rounded down. If they suffer any more Wounds, they die instantly.

## Opportunity attacks
Certain actions expose you to opportunity attacks from enemies in melee range from you. To avoid such an attack, roll Dexterity and add the enemy's Defense. Failure means you get hit, damage equals to the margin of failure. These actions include:

- Moving out of melee range
- Getting up when prone
- Picking up an item from the ground

## Common actions
### Dodge
Until the start of your next turn, any sttack roll made against you has disadvantage if you can see the attacker.
### Feint
Trick opponent into lowering their weapon, allowing the next attack against them to ignore their Defense. To determine success, roll against Cunning and add the target's Defense.
### Grapple
Grab your opponent. Roll Strength and add the target’s Defense. Failure means you get hit, damage equals 10 minus your result. If you succeed, you and your opponent gains the Grappling condition. You may move with your opponent. On their next turn, your opponent may roll Strength to break free.
### Rally
Inspire your party by taking the lead. While moving towards the enemy, roll Courage plus the highest number of HD among the enemies. Restore a number of Hit Points among members of your party equal to the margin of success, starting with the party member with the lowest HP.
### Shove
Shove your opponent. Roll Strength and add your opponent’s Defense. Failure means you get hit, damage equals 10 minus your result. If you succeed, you can shove your opponent Prone, or away from you a number of feet equal to the margin of success.

## Bonus actions
Bonus actions are performed right before your melee atttack.
