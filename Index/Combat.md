## Combat sequence

Combat is divided into rounds. Each round has six phases. Each combatant can move once and perform one action per round.

1. Monster morale
2. Movement
3. Declare spells
4. Ranged attacks
5. Spells
6. Melee and miscellaneous

### Simultaneous actions
In each phase, everyone who wants to act declares their actions, following the declaration order. Then, they roll a d20. Sort the rolls from highest to lowest, and resolve them in that order. Actions by combatants early in the round can invalidate actions of combatants who act later. It's not possible to redeclare actions.

For example: Regdar the fighter is fighting an orc. The orc wants to shove Regdar away, while Regdar is trying to grapple the orc. Regdar rolls 15, while the orc rolls 18. The orc goes first, and pushes Regdar out of melee range. Regdar is now out of melee range, so his grapple fails despite rolling successfully.

#### Grouping
In the melee phase, the GM can choose to separately resolve groups that are out of melee range of each other.

#### Declaration order
The GM declares actions for the monsters first, then players can declare, going clockwise around the table.

#### Advantage and disadvantage
If an action by an earlier combatant confers advantage or disadvantage on a later roll, that combatant rolls a second d20 when their action is being resolved, and uses that result.

### Morale
Determine whether monsters and NPCs fight or flee. Two conditions usually trigger a Morale roll:

1. The first time a monster takes a Wound
2. When half the monsters have been Wounded or incapacitated

To determine Morale, roll 2d6. If the number is higher than any monster's Morale score, that monster flees.

### Movement
Everyone who wants to move in the movement phases rolls Dexterity, sort by margin of success.

## Attacking
When you attack someone, the target number is your relevant attack target plus the enemy's Defense. If the roll is equal or higher than the target, it's a hit.

Damage is equal to the margin of success, plus any modifiers. A successful attack always does at least 1 damage.

Some creatures have attacks that are determined by a damage dice instead of this calculation.

### Melee attacks
When you score a hit in melee, the damage is equal to the margin of success.

#### Melee range
Anyone who is within 5 feet of you is within melee range.

### Ranged attacks
For ranged attacks, the Parry bonus from the target's weapon does not apply.

Each weapon has a Point Blank range. When used beyond this range, the target's Defense increases by +1 for every 10 feet.

If you are in melee, you have disadvantage on ranged attacks.

#### Cover and shooting into melee
A target that's partially covered gets +2 Defense. This includes being behind another creature in melee.

A target that's at least 3/4 covered gets +5 Defense.

An attack that would otherwise hit a target that's behind cover, hits the cover instead. The damage is equal to the cover bonus.

### Spell attacks
When casting a spell in combat, use the same rules as ranged attacks.

Spell attacks are made using Intelligence.

## Hit Points and Wounds
Hit Points are a measure of your stamina and ability to avoid getting seriously injured.

Any damage that reduces you to below 0 Hit Points will give you a Wound. Look up the damage on the Wound Table to determine its Severity.

Each Wound takes one Inventory per Severity. If all your inventory slots are filled up with Wounds or Exhaustion, you’re dead.

### Hit locations and attack type
When the attacker scores a Wound, they can specify what type of attack they want to make, and where the attack is made: head, torso, right or left arm, right or left leg. Attack types are listed on the weapon's stats.

### Critical Hits
If the attacker rolls a natural 20, the attack is always a hit. Additionally, the target receives a Wound that lasts until the end of the next round, and their armor is damaged and takes one Notch. Roll on the Wound Table for the hit location to determine the Wound’s nature.

### Fumbles
A natural 1 on an attack roll is a miss regardless of the target’s Defense and results in a mishap. This means that they slam their weapon into a nearby obstacle, overextend their bow, or overcharge their arcane focus. The item is damaged and takes one Notch.

### Instant Death
If a character would gain a Wound and the damage is equal to their maximum HP, they instead die instantly.

### How to kill a monster
A monster or NPC can have a number of Wounds equivalent to half their Hit Dice, rounded down (minimum one). If they suffer any more Wounds, they die instantly.

## Opportunity attacks
Certain actions expose you to opportunity attacks from enemies in melee range from you. To avoid such an attack, roll Melee + the enemy's Defense. Failure means you get hit, damage equals to 10 minus the result. These actions include:

- Moving out of melee range
- Getting up when prone
- Picking up an item from the ground

A character or monster can only do one opportunity attack every round.

## Gaining advantage or disadvantage
Advantage is not granted by class abilities. Rather, players are encouraged to use the environment to gain advantage or give disadvantage to an enemy in a fight. For example: swing from a chandelier to attack from above, topple a bookshelf over an enemy to disorient them. Generally, each environmental factor only works once per fight.

## Object interactions
Characters get one free object interaction every round. This can be done in any phase. For example: drawing a weapon, opening a door, picking up an item.

## Common actions
### Dodge
Until the next Melee phase, any attack roll made against you has disadvantage if you can see the attacker.

### Feint
Trick opponent into misdirecting their weapon, allowing the next attack against them to ignore their Defense. To determine success, roll against Cunning.

### Grapple
Grab your opponent. Roll against your Strength target modified by the target’s Defense. Failure means you get hit, damage equals 10 minus your result. If you succeed, you and your opponent gain the Grappling condition. You may move with your opponent. In subsequent Melee phases, your opponent may roll Strength to break free.

### Push
When you successfully attack an opponent in melee, you can push them backwards up to 10 feet, following them as they get pushed.

### Rally
Inspire your party by taking the lead. While moving towards the enemy, roll Courage modified by highest number of HD among the enemies. Restore a number of Hit Points among members of your party equal to the margin of success, divided as you choose.

### Shove
Shove your opponent. Roll Strength modified by your opponent’s Defense. Failure means you get hit, damage equals 10 minus your result. If you succeed, you can shove your opponent Prone, or away from you a number of feet equal to the margin of success.
