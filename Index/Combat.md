## Combat sequence

Combat is divided into rounds. Each round has six phases. Each combatant can move once and perform one action per round.

1. Movement
2. Monster morale
3. Declare spells
4. Ranged attacks
5. Spells
6. Melee and miscellaneous

### Declaration order
The GM declares actions for the monsters first, then players can declare, going clockwise around the table.

### Simultaneous actions
In each phase, everyone who wants to act declares their actions, following the declaration order. Then, they roll a d20. Sort the rolls from highest to lowest, and resolve them in that order. Actions by combatants early in the round can invalidate actions of combatants who act later. It's not possible to redeclare actions.

For example: Regdar the fighter is fighting an orc. The orc wants to shove Regdar away, while Regdar is trying to hit the orc with his sword. Regdar rolls 15, while the orc rolls 18. The orc goes first, and pushes Regdar out of melee range. Regdar is now out of melee range, so his attack now misses despite rolling successfully.

#### Advantage and disadvantage
If an action by an earlier combatant confers advantage or disadvantage on a later roll, that combatant rolls a second d20 when their action is being resolved, and uses that result.

### Movement
If there is conflict of who will reach a space in a turn, the player needs to succeed on a Dexterity check to be first.

## Attacking
When you attack someone, the target number is your relevant attack target plus the enemy's Defense. If the roll is equal or higher than the target, it's a hit.

Damage is equal to the margin of success, plus any modifiers. A successful attack always does at least 1 damage, even if a modifier would bring it below 1.

Some creatures have attacks that are determined by a damage dice instead of this calculation.

### Melee attacks
When you score a hit in melee, the damage is equal to the margin of success plus your Damage modifier.

### Ranged attacks
For ranged attacks, the Parry bonus from the target's weapon does not apply.

Each weapon has a Point Blank range. When used beyond this range, the target's Defense increases by +1 for every 10 feet.

If you are in melee, you have disadvantage on ranged attacks.

#### Cover and shooting into melee
A target that's partially covered gets +2 Defense. This includes being behind another creature in melee.

A target that's at least 3/4 covered gets +5 Defense.

An attack that would otherwise hit a target that's behind cover, hits the cover instead. The damage is equal to the cover bonus.

### Spell attacks
When casting a spell in combat, use the same rules as ranged attacks.

Spell attacks are made using Intelligence.

## Hit locations and attack type
The attacker specifies what type of attack they want to make, and where the attack is made: head, torso, right or left arm, right or left leg. Attack types are listed on the weapon's stats.

Making the same kind of attack twice in a turn grants disadvantage on that attack roll.

_Do not repeat the tactics which have gained you one victory, but let your methods be regulated by the infinite variety of circumstances._

— Sun Tzu, the Art of War

### Critical Hits
If the attacker rolls a natural 20, the attack is always a hit. Additionally, the target receives a Wound that lasts until the end of their next turn, and their armor is damaged and takes one Notch. Roll on the Wound Table for the hit location to determine the Wound’s nature.

### Fumbles
A natural 1 on an attack roll is a miss regardless of the target’s Defense and results in a mishap. This means that they slam their weapon into a nearby obstacle, overextend their bow, or overcharge their arcane focus. The item is damaged and takes one Notch.

## Hit Points and Wounds
Hit Points are a measure of your stamina and ability to avoid getting seriously injured.

Any damage that reduces you to below 0 Hit Points will give you a Wound. Look up the damage on the Wound Table to determine its nature.

Each Wound takes up one Inventory slot. If all your inventory slots are filled up with Wounds or Exhaustion, you’re dead.
### Instant Death
If a character would gain a Wound and the damage is equal to their maximum HP, they instead die instantly.
### How to kill a monster
A monster or NPC can have a number of Wounds equivalent to half their Hit Dice, rounded down (minimum one). If they suffer any more Wounds, they die instantly.

## Opportunity attacks
Certain actions expose you to opportunity attacks from enemies in melee range from you. To avoid such an attack, roll Dexterity modified by the enemy's Defense. Failure means you get hit, damage equals to the margin of failure. These actions include:

- Moving out of melee range
- Getting up when prone
- Picking up an item from the ground

## Common actions
### Dodge
Until the start of your next turn, any attack roll made against you has disadvantage if you can see the attacker.

### Feint
Trick opponent into misdirecting their weapon, allowing the next attack against them to ignore their Defense. To determine success, roll against Cunning.

### Grapple
Grab your opponent. Roll Strength and add the target’s Defense. Failure means you get hit, damage equals 10 minus your result. If you succeed, you and your opponent gain the Grappling condition. You may move with your opponent. On their next turn, your opponent may roll Strength to break free.

### Rally
Inspire your party by taking the lead. While moving towards the enemy, roll Courage modified by highest number of HD among the enemies. Restore a number of Hit Points among members of your party equal to the margin of success, starting with the party member with the lowest HP.

### Shove
Shove your opponent. Roll Strength modified by your opponent’s Defense. Failure means you get hit, damage equals 10 minus your result. If you succeed, you can shove your opponent Prone, or away from you a number of feet equal to the margin of success.
