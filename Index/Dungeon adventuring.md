Time in the dungeon is divided into turns, which are roughly 10 minutes long. Each turn follows this sequence:
1. Wandering monsters
2. The party describes their actions
3. Actions are resolved and their results described by the GM
4. End of turn. The GM updates time records, and the players update any information on their sheets, such as the status of torches, items, and spells

## Doors
Most doors in the dungeon will be closed, and possibly stuck or locked.

### Stuck doors
Forcing a stuck door requires a successful Strength check. 

Failing to open a stuck door removes any chance of surprising monsters on the other side.

### Locked doors
Opening a locked door requires a successful Burglary check.

### Listening at doors
Hearing sounds beyond a door requires a successful Instinct check. Only one attempt may be made by the party. Some monsters may not make any sound.

### Secret doors
Characters may search a 10x10 foot area secret doors. If they're searching in the right place, they can make an Intelligence check to find the door.
