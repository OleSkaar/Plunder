## Skin-changer
Also called changelings, skinwalkers, or feybairn, skin-changers are believed to be fey spirits left in place of stolen children. As such, they are usually ostracized from their communities.

They appear mostly human, but have wizened features coupled with parchment-like skin and dark eyes.

A mirror will reveal a skin-changer’s true fey form, which appears to humanoids as a twisted, grotesque version of their own kind.

### Horrifying Visage
Once per long rest, a skin-changer may reveal its true form, forcing all humanoids to see it to roll a Morale check.
