When the empires of old fell to the Frost, their great works of magic were extinguished, just as their cities were ground to dust by the ice. But there are those who seek to revive these arcane practices, and who will stop at nothing to achieve it. These folk are called wizards.

### Lumotheurgy
Manipulate light or darkness.

Range: Melee (1d), Short (2d), Medium (3d), Long (4d); Target: A single point in range; Duration: Concentration

Fill the area around the selected point with light or darkness. Darkness is always inky black, but the strength of the light depends on the amount of MD.

1-2d: Bright at the source, but with a dim aura
3-4d: The area is bathed in daylight

### Transmutation
Transfer an aspect of a creature or an object to another. For instance, turn a sword into a twig, give a human the gills of a fish for underwater breathing, or turn yourself into a dragon. Using this spell requires holding the creature part or object the aspect is transferred from, which will whither and pulverize in the process.

Range: Melee; Target: A single object or creature; Duration: (sum) rounds

The types of targets are limited by the amount of MD invested:

1d: A non-heavy inanimate object
2d: Heavy inanimate object
3d: Part of a humanoid-sized creature
4d: A whole humanoid-sized creature

### Metamagic
Once per short rest, you can twist a spell as you cast it, changing some of its aspects, using one of the following options:

- **Subtle spell.** Cast a spell without the verbal and somatic components
- **Improvise focus**. Channel your energy through an object, allowing it to act as an arcane focus. The object must be made from precious metals, gemstone, or glass. It shatters and is pulverized on use
- **Quicken spell**. Cast the spell as a bonus action
- **Extend spell.** Double the spell's range.

### Ritual spellcasting
Using salt or chalk, you can draw a magic circle on the ground. Anything inside this circle will count as a target of the next spell you cast. The circle is consumed when the spell ends.
