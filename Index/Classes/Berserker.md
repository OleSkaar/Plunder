## Talents
When you gain a new Talent, choose one from this list:
### Beastskin
Using the skin of a beast you or your party has slain, you can perform a ritual at a bonfire to imbue yourself with one characteristic of that beast, as long as you’re wearing its skin (typically as a cloak). The beast must be your size or larger, but it can’t have more HD than you.

Every time you rest while wearing this cloak, the spirit of the beast begins to take over. Roll a HD. On a 3 or less, lose it, and gain this condition:

**One with the beast**

This condition stacks. For each one you have, gain another effect from this list:

1. You can’t and don’t want to take off the beast pelt
2. You crave the taste of blood and raw meat, and can’t eat anything else
3. Lose the ability to speak
4. Become the beast

### Eat anything
Steel yourself, and you can eat anything, up to twice your size, without any harm. If what you eat is actually nutritious, you gain a bonus HD, next to your regular HD. Once you’ve used this ability, you can’t use it again until you’ve taken a long rest.

### Axe vaulter
You can use a longaxe or spear to launch yourself twice as far or high as normal, and use axes instead of climbing gear. If you fall on an enemy while using this ability, you can transfer all falling damage to them.

### Evil eye
Channel your fury into a curse that either renders the target’s weapons blunt and brittle (they take 1 Notch and can’t deal wounds), or intimidates them (they have to roll Morale). For each target, roll a HD. On a 3 or less, you lose the HD. The effect lasts as long as you concentrate on it.

### Blót
Sacrifice any number of living creatures in the name of a specific purpose. You may invite any number of people to the ritual, but each person must be drenched in blood over the course of the ritual. For each HD sacrificed in this way, a blood drink can be prepared. Drinking this grants an automatic success on the next action if contributes directly towards achieving the purpose. You can make one drink per participant in the ritual. A blót can only be performed once every new moon.
