## Talents
When you gain a new Talent, choose one from this list:
### Scorpion stance
When you use this ability, add +5 to your Defense until the end of your next turn. If someone attacks you before then and misses, you strike them in a riposte and they take damage equal to the margin of error.

### Panache
When the group is declaring actions, you may use this ability to declare that you go first. Roll your Hit Dice and add the number to the first roll you make. If you roll a 1 on the Hit Dice, the check fails regardless of the total result.

### Uncanny acrobatics
Jump twice as far as normal, or do an acrobatic stunt like swing from a chandelier, slide down a bannister, or land on your feet on uneven ground, without rolling a check. When you use this ability, roll a HD. On a 1, lose the HD.

### Improvisational genius
You are proficient in using any object as a weapon. Objects you can carry in one hand count as having Finesse. The first time you use this ability in an encounter, the enemy is considered surprised.

### Notorious
Pick a nickname and a calling sign representing you (like a letter carved on a wall, an outrageous outfit, or a certain flower). By leaving behind a calling sign or otherwise associating your nickname with the scene of a heroic deed, you gain a point of notoriety with that location.

When returning, at the start of any encounter, you may dramatically reveal the symbol, and everyone will instantly know who you are. You may then reduce any target by the notoriety number in that location, until you roll a 1.
