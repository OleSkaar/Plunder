_Through the darkness of future past,
the magician longs to see. 
One chants out between two worlds:_

_Fire walk with me._

When the lands were under the Great Frost, the pyromancers kept fire alive and brought light and warmth to desperate townships. Now, with their order no longer needed, they have become outcasts and mercenaries.
