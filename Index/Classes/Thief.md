Examples:

- **Throw sand**: Blind opponent until the end of their next round.
- **Low blow:** Opponent is Dazed until the end of their next round.

## Talents
When you gain a new Talent, choose one from this list:
### Sneak attack
When you hit a target with an attack and you have advantage, you can choose to not apply the attack's damage to the target, and instead apply a Wound to the target, rolling on the Wound table for the hit location you choose.

### Wall climb
Climb regular walls without making a check, and climb impossible walls with a check.

### Use Magic Device
You can use an action and roll a Cunning check to try to use any magic device, ignoring requirements such as class, level, alignment, or skill requirement.

### Great escape
You can automatically escape from something that is restraining you and that you could plausibly escape from. This includes grapples, lynchings, and awkward social situations, but not sealed coffins. You can’t use this ability again until you have acquired some treasure.

### Impersonate
If you have listened to someone’s voice for a minute, you can use this ability to impersonate their voice and mannerisms perfectly until your next long rest.
