You understand what an animal wants or fears. If you are able to help the animal with either of these things, you can make an Instinct check, with the animal's HD added as difficulty. On success, the animal becomes your loyal companion, as long as you treat it well. You can command it on a bonus action. You can only have one such companion at a time.

At level 5, you can have any number of companions with total HD up to your HD.

### The Seven Secrets of Herblore
Craft useful ointments from herbs found in nature. When you are in one of these locations, you know where to look for these herbs, using Survival. Gain a number of uses of each herb equal to the margin of success. The GM may add a difficulty modifier if growth is sparse in the area.

|Herb|Location|
|---|---|
|Wolvesbane|Mountaintop, cliffs |
|Mirrorroot|Over stalagmites and under stalactites |
|Blood moss|Sinkholes, predator lairs|
|Belladonna|Waterfalls, underground streams|
|Hemlock|Graveyards|
|Ramson (garlic)|Forest clearings|
|Corpsebloom|Sarcophagi, long-dead corpses|
|King’s foil|Forest clearings|

These herbs can be combined to create these ointments:

|Ointment|Effect|Herbs|
|---|---|---|
|Poultice|Grants auto success on one Recovery roll|Blood Moss, Belladonna, King’s foil|
|Antidote|Remove 1 Poisoned condition|Wolvesbane or any venom, garlic, mirrorroot|

|Confuse|Target is lost in hallucinations. Each round, roll 1d6, on 1 will attack own friends, on 6 will attack party members|Hemlock, Wolvesbane, Belladonna|

### Vanish
While standing still in dense foliage or shadows, you can choose to become invisible until you move again.

### Beast scent
Sharpening your scent, you can sense the direction of a type of beast you choose within a day’s travel. If you have an item that has been in touch with a particular beast, you can smell that individual. The scent lasts as long you concentrate on it. When you use it, roll a HD. On a 3 or less, you lose the HD.

### Eyes of the wild
While holding something from an animal’s body (e.g. a tuft of hair, a claw, a feather), you can focus your inner eye and see through the animal’s eyes. Your own eyes roll to the back of your skull, and your body remains in place. While doing this, you can command the creature to move to a spot in sight or to stand still. Each time you do so, the item withers, taking a Notch. At 3 Notches, it rots completely, and your senses return to your body.
