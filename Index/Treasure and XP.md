Each SP of treasure brought back to town is worth 1 XP.

XP is divided equally between all members of the party, including retainers. Retainers suffer a -50% penalty to the XP they receive, however, as they are just following orders.

## XP from combat
Defeating monsters also grants the party XP, as listed in their stat block.

## Fallen comrades
Bringing back the body of a fallen comrade and giving them a proper burial grants XP equal to 20% of their XP total. This does not apply if they were willfully slain by another PC.

## What is treasure?
Gems, jewelry, gold, and finely crafted objects all count as treasure, and XP is awarded according to their value in SP, divided equally between party members.

Magic items, being their own reward, don't grant XP.

 _I shall not today attempt further to define the kinds of material I understand to be embraced within that shorthand description, and perhaps I could never succeed in intelligibly doing so. But I know it when I see it._
