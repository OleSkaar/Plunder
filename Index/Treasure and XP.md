Each SP of treasure brought back to town is worth 1 XP.

XP is divided equally between all members of the party, including retainers. Retainers suffer a -50% penalty to the XP they receive, however, since they are merely following orders.

## XP from combat
Defeating monsters also grants the party XP, as listed in their stat block.

## Fallen comrades
Bringing back the body of a fallen comrade and giving them a proper burial grants XP equal to 20% of their XP total. 

## What is treasure?
Gems, jewelry, gold, and finely crafted objects all count as treasure, and XP is awarded according to their value in SP, divided equally between party members.

Magic items, being their own reward, don't grant XP.

In Plunder, XP is gained by plundering loot and bringing back to safety. There are also some XP awarded for defeating enemies, but treasure is the main source of XP. Combat may not always be the best course of action!
