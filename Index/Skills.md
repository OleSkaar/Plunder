Skills represent fields of knowledge that your character is familiar with. That means you have a general knowledge of the field, and can easily complete tasks relevant to the skill.

If the GM rules that it's uncertain that you will succeed at a task, they may ask you to roll a skill check. The target number is decided by your rank.

There are four ranks for a skill: Apprentice, Journeyman, Expert, and Master.

| Level | Target Number |
| ---- | ---- |
| Apprentice | 15 |
| Journeyman | 12 |
| Expert | 9 |
| Master | 5 |

For instance, Milos the rogue is a Journeyman burglar, and they want to pick the lock of a chest. They have a Dexterity of 16. To succeed, they need to roll 11 or higher.

A roll of 1 is always a failure.

If you don't have the skill, you will most often not be able to attempt it. The GM may rule that you can try, but rolling with disadvantage.
