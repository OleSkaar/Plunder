## Roll-over dice 
All player rolls are resolved with a d20 versus a pre-calculated target number. No modifiers, what you roll is what you get! 

## Single-roll combat 
A single d20 roll determines whether a combat action succeeds, how much damage is done, and when in the round this occurs.

## Phased combat, simultaneous turns
Combat rounds are divided into phases, and everyone who acts in a phase rolls simultaneously. Rolls are resolved from highest to lowest.

## Wound effects 
Simple wound system to give the game a more visceral feel.

## Reimagined ability scores 
Three of the six classic ability scores have been replaced - each ability score now has clear active uses.

## Weapon choice matters 
Your weapon determines how hard it is to score a hit on you. Every weapon also has different properties, giving you meaningful choices.

## Active abilities 
Classes and kin mostly grant active abilities, not passive or conditional benefits you have to memorize.

## Easy inventory and item durability
A slot-based system makes it easy to track what your character is carrying.
