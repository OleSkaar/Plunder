## Armor
Wearing armor has two benefits:

1. Increasing your Hit Points
2. Decreasing the Severity of Wounds

## Armor is HP
Each armor gives you a fixed amount of HP per level. The heavier the armor, the more HP.

### Protection from Wounds
Armor also provides protection against Wounds. When you would suffer a Wound, subtract the number for your armor type from the damage total before looking up the Wound result. If the number is negative, you don't suffer a Wound.

<!--raw-typst
#meleeTable[
| Leather | Wound Protection | HP / Level | Slots |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Leather | 3 | +1 | 1 |
| Chain | 5 | +2 | 1 |
| Scale | 8 | +4 | 2 |
]-->

### Optional: Armor sets
Only a complete set of armor grants the HP bonus. However, individual pieces grant crit protection where they are worn (such as a helmet protecting the head).
