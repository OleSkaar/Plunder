A lightweight RPG combining D&D 5e mechanics with ideas plundered from Old School Renaissance blogs. Designed for Original D&D compatibility. The emphasis is on quick action resolution, streamlined characters, and creative problem solving.

Plunder's implied setting differs somewhat from the standard 5e setting. It's a scattered realm of towns and cities separated by dangerous wilderness, with no powerful empires or kings to enforce a feudal system. Instead, each settlement is on its own. The empires of old were destroyed by the Great Frost, but it is now thawing, laying bare the hidden treasures.

There are also no clerics, and no organized religion, though many local sects and strange faiths. Magic is rare and dangerous.

Most importantly, the game is designed to be used with old school modules. This means itâ€™s **more deadly,** and that creative problem solving is usually better than trying to fight everything. The characters are assumed to be competent at a few things, but not superheroes. Classes are designed to provide players with options, not optimization.
