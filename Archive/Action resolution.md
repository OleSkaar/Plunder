Whenever you attempt an action that might fail, the GM can ask you to roll a check to resolve the action.

All actions are resolved using a d20. Rolling higher is always better. The difficulty of the check is determined by the target number on your character sheet, plus any difficulty modifier added by the GM. 

To succeed, simply roll equal to or higher than this number.
